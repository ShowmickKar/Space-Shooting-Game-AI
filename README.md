# **Space Shooting Game AI**

This is the single-player version of my Space-Shooting game. I implemented a simple AI for the right spaceship and gave it the ability to attack and defend itself.

To test the game, simply clone the repository on your computer and run the main.py script from your IDE or terminal.

<a href="https://github.com/ShowmickKar/Space-Shooting-Game-Double-Player">This</a> is the repository for the double-player version of this game if you want to check that out.

## **Game Control:**

- Use **W-A-S-D** for movement and **LCTRL** to shoot bullets

## **Prerequisites:**

- To run the program and mess with the code, you need to have pygame installed on your computer. To install pygame, open up your terminal(or Command Prompt if you are on Windows) and type

```bash
    pip install pygame
```
